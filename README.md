## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programming enthusiast at the start of my coding journey, eager to learn and grow. My interests lie in building foundational skills, working on beginner projects, and understanding the basics of cloud and data modeling. With each project, I aim to get a little closer to mastering the craft.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Some beginner programming projects to build my skills and understanding, especially with data modeling and cloud solutions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning many branches of programming and web development. The languages that i have learned/ learning are all listed below, even though most of them are at a begginer level.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Beginner-friendly projects that can help me learn and grow. Iâ€™d love to team up on small, open-source projects or anything related to simple data applications.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Tips for learning new languages, best practices for coding efficiently, and understanding the basics of cloud and data modeling.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Right here on GitHub! Iâ€™m also open to connecting on other platforms if you want to exchange tips and tricks.
